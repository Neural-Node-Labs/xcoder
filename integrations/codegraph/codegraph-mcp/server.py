"""
Codegraph MCP server.

Wraps the codegraph HTTP API as MCP tools so any MCP-compatible agent
(Claude Code, Claude Desktop, a custom agent loop) can explore a codebase's
dependency graph and trigger re-indexing, without ever loading the whole
repo into context.

This process does no static analysis itself - it is a thin, stateless
adapter. All graph facts come from the codegraph backend over HTTP,
authenticated with a per-user API key (see README.md in this folder).

Codegraph is multi-project: every graph-query tool takes a `project_id`.
Call list_projects() first to discover ids (and to see which one is
CODEGRAPH_PROJECT_ID's default, if that env var is set).

Environment variables:
  CODEGRAPH_API_URL     Base URL of the codegraph API (default: http://localhost:8000)
  CODEGRAPH_API_KEY     API key for a codegraph user (required)
  CODEGRAPH_PROJECT_ID  Optional default project id, used when a tool call
                         omits project_id.
